**********************
Slow Motion project
**********************
The task is to Write a code using OpenCV which can slow down a video to 25% of its original speed. The input is a 10 sec video clip (24fps). 

Technical details 
=================
1) Used farneback optical flow.
2) Using inverse warping (remap) with linear interpolation
3) Bluring the optical flow.

Along with this project the following files are attached
========================================================
1) slomoalgo.h, slomoalgo.cpp, main.cpp
2) install.sh (To check if cmake is installed, if not install and build the project)
3) slomo.avi (Output of 4x slowmotion video of jump.mp4)
4) jump.mp4 (Source video to test)

=====================
How to install.
=====================
1) Download the slomopro.zip and unzip.
2) cd slomoproj/
3) ./install.sh

=====================
How to run
=====================
1) cd build/
2) Can call in any of the below 3 ways
   ./slowmotion <Slowing speed> <input video location> <output video location>
   ./slowmotion 4 ../jump.mp4 ../output.avi
   ./slowmotion 2
   ./slowmotion 


======================

Note : Incase you face problem in running the executables. Delete the /build folder and follow "How to install" instructions.
